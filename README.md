# Module 10 Challenge: SQLAlchemy Weather Analysis

## Overview
In this challenge, I used **SQLAlchemy**, Python's SQL toolkit, to analyze and explore climate data. The goal is to retrieve and process weather data stored in a SQLite database and visualize the results using **Python's data analysis and visualization tools**.

## Objectives
1. **Database Interaction**:
   - Connect to the SQLite database using SQLAlchemy's ORM.
   - Query the database to retrieve temperature, precipitation, and other weather data.

2. **Data Analysis**:
   - Analyze the retrieved data to uncover trends, such as:
     - Average temperature.
     - Precipitation levels over time.

3. **Data Visualization**:
   - Create visualizations using tools like Matplotlib or Pandas to present the analysis results.

4. **Flask Application**:
   - Build a Flask application to serve the data and visualizations as a simple web interface.

## Deliverables
- Python scripts for:
  - Querying and analyzing the SQLite database.
  - Creating data visualizations.
- Flask application to display the results.

## Usage
1. Run the Python scripts to interact with the SQLite database and perform analysis.
2. Launch the Flask application to view the analysis and visualizations in a browser.
